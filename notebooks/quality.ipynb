    "Let's now discuss masures of quality for the generated images, specifically three of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BPD (Bits Per Dimension):** Measures how well a model compresses data; lower BPD means better likelihood of the data under the model. Common in likelihood-based models.\n",
    "- **FID (Fréchet Inception Distance):** Compares real and generated image distributions using features from an Inception network; lower FID means more realistic and diverse images.\n",
    "- **IS (Inception Score):** Evaluates image quality and diversity using the Inception model’s output; higher IS means images are both sharp (confident labels) and diverse (many classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that calculating FID and IS required loading an Inception V3 model, a convolutional neural network architecture that is part of the Inception family of models, developed by Google, and performing many forward passes, so this can be computatinally intensive and require some significant GPU memory, specially with larger `num_eval_samples`.\n",
